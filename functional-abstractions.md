# Building abstractions with functions

Computing is representing information, specifying logic for how to process it, and designing abstractions to manage the complexity of the logic.

Composing Programs uses Python because the language has i) emphasized the human interpretability of Python code and ii) is multiparadigm.

## Expressions and Statements

Broadly speaking, computer programs are composed of instructions to:

1. Compute a value
2. Execute an action

An expression computes values: the combination of data (e.g. variables, literals) and logic (e.g. functions, methods) that resolves to a value.

A statement executes an action that don't necessarily compute a value. For example, statements include:

- Variable assignment
- Conditional operation
- Functiona calls
- `for` or `while` Loops
